# Why contribute?

- Consolidating the most popular questions into this FAQ book will hopefully help us reduce both question and answer fatigue.
Instead of answering the same type of question multiple times, we can refer to the FAQ and update it for multiple questions.
- Issues and pull requests, when created, are recorded on GitHub [contribution histories](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/viewing-contributions-on-your-profile).
These histories provide visual proof of contribution to open-source projects.
Some employers look out for these contributions when making decisions to hire employees.
- For users who are new to `.git`, this project provides a platform to practice version control.

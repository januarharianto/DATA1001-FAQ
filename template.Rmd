## Divide your answer into sections

If your answer is long, consider dividing it into sections. 
It might also be useful to consider splitting the answer into two or more FAQs.

## Add images if you want 

Use a code chunk to do so. All image or table assets should be saved into the assets folder with a unique name.

Don't forget to remove `eval=FALSE` to activate the code chunk. 
The option `out.width` helps you adjust the size of the image.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/yourimage.png')
```

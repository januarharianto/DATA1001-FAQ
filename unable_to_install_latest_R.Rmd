# Unable to install latest version of R from CRAN

This issue happens mostly on macOS since the operating system stopped supporting 32-bit R a few years ago.

If you have an older operating system, consider upgrading your system to **Snow Leopard (10.6) or above** as this will fix the issue.

If that is not possible, you may also install a legacy version of R, but this would mean that you will not be able to use the latest features of R. 
For this reason, the better alternative would be to utilise a **cloud version of RStudio**. In this situation, you are "streaming" an RStudio interface through your web browser. 
An internet connection must be available for this to work.

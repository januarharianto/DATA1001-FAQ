# What's in the data wrangling FAQ?

This section contains suggested answers for questions related to:

- data summaries e.g. `mean()`, `median()`
- data manipulation (to obtain summaries) e.g. when you want to obtain mean values by category, or when you want to filter data before summarising.

Generally, we will try to provide both base R and `tidyverse` options in the responses.
